Create a directory within dat-chapter-1 called labs and within that create a directory called exercise_1. As we always will do, within exercise_1, create a README.md with the following problem statement (feel to free use your own words)

My objective in doing this problem is to exercise my logic skills and practice for loops/list comprehensions.

PROBLEM: Write a function that takes a list of numbers `numbers` and
returns a sublist of `numbers` with only those numbers that are divisible by 33.
